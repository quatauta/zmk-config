# Wireless ZMK Kyria from splitkb.com

Criteria for my keyboard:

* Columnar stagger, moderate or aggressive
* Two-halfs split
* USB-C
* Bluetooth/wireless
* Reasonably long battery life
* Most parts available from a single shop in Europe

The [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) would fit well but is wired-only.
It shipps from Taiwan and costs nearly twice compated to the DIY SplitKB Kyria.

### Case

I want to get an as-low-as-possible build while avoiding the costs of Mill Max hot-swap sockets. I will start with "naked" PBC + top plate + Kailh hot swap sockets.

Once I am happy with the keyboard, I will add a 3D printed low-profile case.

* 1x [Kyria rev3 Low Profile Case; Top Plate / Black FR4 / Set of 2](https://splitkb.com/products/kyria-rev3-low-profile-case?variant=43643293925635)

* 1x [Aurora Low Profile Case Hardware Kit](https://splitkb.com/products/aurora-low-profile-case-hardware-kit?variant=43669816574211) (just in case of need)

### Batteries

To decide :-)

Depending on the space available between the controllers and PCB, 301230 or 601230 lithium polimer batters.
