## Case

I want to get an as-low-as-possible build while avoiding the costs of Mill Max hot-swap sockets. I will start with "naked" PBC + top plate + Kailh hot swap sockets.

Once I am happy with the keyboard, I will add a 3D printed low-profile case.

* 1x [Aurora Low Profile Case Hardware Kit](https://splitkb.com/products/aurora-low-profile-case-hardware-kit?variant=43669816574211) (just in case of need)

## Batteries

To decide :-)

Depending on the space available between the controllers and PCB, 301230 or 601230 lithium polimer batters.
